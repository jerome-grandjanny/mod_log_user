 mod_log_user - Username logging module for apache httpd 2.0/2.2

 Compile & install with : apxs2 -i -a -c mod_log_user.c

 This very tiny module fills the r->user field with username so that
 it is available for logging.

 If there is an Authentication header, gets username so that it is available
 for logging even if there is no Authentication module involved. Works with
 Basic and Digest authentication.

 This module can be useful in a reverse proxy environment where the proxy
 logs all the traffic and authentication is done by proxyfied servers but
 you want to log usernames in the main proxy logfile.

 There is no configuration parameter, no activation switch, just load
 the module and it will silently do its work.
